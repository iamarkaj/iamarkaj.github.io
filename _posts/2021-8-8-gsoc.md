GSOC is a global program that connects open-source organizations with student developers. Students spend the summer writing open-source software and connecting with other Google Summer of Code students across the world.



## JDEROBOT - ROBOTICS ACADEMY 

JdeRobot’s Robotics-Academy is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises using Python language where the student has to code the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It uses standard middleware and libraries as ROS and OpenCV, so the student learns the state-of-the-art tools.


## ABOUT PROJECT

Currently, there are 9 drone exercises available in Gazebo-9 and ROS-melodic. The goal of this project is to migrate the drone exercises from v2.1 (ROS node based) to v2.3 (Web/Docker-based) of the Robotics Academy. Introduce a new drone-based exercise: Drone Package Delivery in ROS-noetic and Gazebo-11 and create their requisite gazebo models.


## WORK DONE <a href="https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2021-Arkajyoti_Basak/blog/2021-08-18-Final-Blog/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Report-black" alt="stream" width="75" height="35"/></a>

All the 9 drone exercises of RoboticsAcademy are now available in a web-based template. 3 new Gazebo models are now available in drone_assets. Almost all the web-based exercises of RoboticsAcademy are now available in ROS1-Noetic (with hardware acceleration support only for Ubuntu+NVIDIA). The 9 drone exercises have support for on-demand logs (instructions). The drone-cat-mouse exercise has support for automatic evaluation of the cat robot (testing).


## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

It has been a great journey till now and I can only see it becoming better. The tasks I’ve completed so far have really allowed me to tie all of my knowledge together and create an overall view of what I know.

Thank You to JdeRobot and Google Summer of Code. Writing open-source source software has been a valuable learning experience for me, and I am excited to keep contributing to the JdeRobot community. Thank you to Pedro, Nikhil, Prof. JoseMaría Cañas and other admins. Your mentorship and support have made this a very special experience for me.
