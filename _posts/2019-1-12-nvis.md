This is an Arduino-based project using an NVIS 3302ARD. This project is completed as a part of Engineering Design 2, CSE Department, TIET.

- Integrated the robot with an ultrasonic sensor to demonstrate object avoidance capability.
- Wrote codes to read pulse width of gantry transmitter and trigger stop buggy function by detecting individual gantry.
- Wrote configuration program to demonstrate Xbee 10-13 module communication between two PCs using XCTU.
