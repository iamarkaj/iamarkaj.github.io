Hello,

I am Arkajyoti Basak, a free and open-source developer with 5 years of experience in robotics software technologies. Currently, I am a member of [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io), a non-profit organization, and contribute to the robotics lab URJC, specifically in the maintenance of its drone section.

Having graduated from Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology ([TIET](https://www.thapar.edu/)) in 2022 with a Bachelorâ€™s degree, I have since been deeply involved in assisting numerous start-ups and small businesses with cutting-edge robotics solutions. My expertise spans across areas such as SLAM, Extended Kalman Filters (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF), Localization techniques, and Sensor Fusion.
