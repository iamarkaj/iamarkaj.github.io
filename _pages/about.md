I am completing my undergraduate studies in mechanical engineering at the Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology ([TIET](https://www.thapar.edu/)), Patiala. While at TIET, I worked as a [student contributor at JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/community/contributors/), a part of the Robotics Lab URJC. I joined [Elektrobit India](https://www.elektrobit.com/) full-time as a software engineer in the ADAS team towards the beginning of the final semester.

My current area of focus is the application of computer vision and reinforcement learning for generalizable autonomy in robotics.
